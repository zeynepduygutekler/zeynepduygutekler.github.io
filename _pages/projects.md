*Sep 17 – Present*
* Developing a smart plug load management system that automates the operation of different plug
loads based on the occupants’ presence information.
* Used Python to develop a Bluetooth-based indoor localisation system by deploying Raspberry Pi
sensors to detect occupant presence and location using IoT and mobile sensing technologies.
* Proposed a data fusion approach which analyses occupant presence and power consumption data
to detect plug load interaction.
* Developed a real-time plug load identification module that performs device-type classification
using machine learning techniques.

## Geolocation-based AR Game for Climate Change Awareness and Action 
*Aug 20-Present*

A mobile game targeting children 8 to 11 years old has been developed by Singapore University of
Technology and Design (SUTD) with the aim of promoting climate action and encouraging green behaviour
while still providing a fun and engaging game that will educate players on what climate change and
climate action is about. Utilising augmented reality, as well as geolocation function, the game is 
designed to provide not only an educational and engaging game to raise awareness about climate action, 
but to also get people to explore their environment and provide an immersive experience in which the story 
of the game involves the degraded world around the players.

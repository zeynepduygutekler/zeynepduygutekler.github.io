## The UK Energy Demand Observation and Laboratory (EDOL)
*Sep 23 – Present*
* Contributing to the development of Observatory (2,000 representative GB homes) with high resolution, longitudinal, technical and social data disaggregated to the level of activities, appliances, and occupants.
* Developed household load profiles (i.e., archetypes) based on energy demand and sociodemographics in the UK. [SOON]

## A Total Building Performance Approach to Real-time Occupant Centric Sensing and Control for Mixed Mode Ventilation in the Tropics
*Aug 21 – Aug 23*
* Developed a hybrid active transfer learning framework for data-efficient personal thermal comfort models using limited data. [PDF](../files/ATL-thermalcomfort.pdf)
* Developed a novel feature selection algorithm for occupancy detection using deep learning approaches 
to achieve minimum sensing strategy in smart buildings. [[PDF](../files/minsensing-occupancy.pdf)]
* Conducted a comprehensive data collection effort for obtaining real-time BMS data for 
building operations, indoor environmental quality, outdoor weather conditions and energy consumption 
together with high-resolution occupancy information. [[PDF](../files/robod.pdf)]

## Plug-mate: An IoT-based Occupant-driven Smart Plug Load Management System in Office Spaces 
*Sep 17 – Aug 21*
* Developed a smart plug load management system that automates the operation of different plug
loads based on the occupants’ presence information. [[PDF](../files/plug-mate.pdf)]
* Used Python to develop a Bluetooth-based indoor localisation system by deploying Raspberry Pi
sensors to detect occupant presence and location using IoT and mobile sensing technologies. [[PDF](../files/scalable-ble.pdf)]
* Developed a real-time plug load identification module that performs device-type classification
using machine learning techniques. [[PDF](../files/plugload-identification.pdf)]
* User testing, focus group discussions and surveys were conducted to understand perceptions on the adoption of smart energy management systems. [PDF](../files/sems-adoption.pdf)

## Geolocation-based AR Game for Climate Change Awareness and Action 
*Aug 20-Aug 21*

A mobile game targeting children 8 to 11 years old has been developed by Singapore University of
Technology and Design (SUTD) with the aim of promoting climate action and encouraging green behaviour
while still providing a fun and engaging game that will educate players on what climate change and
climate action is about. Utilising augmented reality, as well as geolocation function, the game is 
designed to provide not only an educational and engaging game to raise awareness about climate action, 
but to also get people to explore their environment and provide an immersive experience in which the story 
of the game involves the degraded world around the players. [[PDF](../files/project-pear.pdf)]

## Plug-mate Interface: A Web-based User Interface for a Smart Plug Load Management System
*Apr 20 – Sep 20*
* Designed and developed a web-based user interface for a smart plug load management system
using the Django Web Framework, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
* Integrated Dash-Plotly applications to visualise the user’s energy consumption on a smart energy
dashboard.
* Integrated React applications to capture user preferred settings for different control features.

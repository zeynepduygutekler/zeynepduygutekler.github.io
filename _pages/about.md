I am currently a Senior Research Associate in the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/zeynep-duygu-tekler/) at the **University of Oxford** :gb: At Oxford, I am part of the [ZERO Insitute](https://zero.ox.ac.uk/people/zeynep-tekler/) and hold a Junior Research Fellowship at [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/our-people/zey-nep/). 
I am also a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of the Built Environment at the **National University of Singapore** :singapore: in 2021-2023.
I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering Product Development from **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre** :singapore: :us: in 2021. 
Prior to my doctoral studies, I received both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial Engineering, and Economics 
as a double major from **Isik University** :tr:, where I was awarded as the Valedictorian :trophy: in 2015. 

Broadly, my research interests include:
* Occupant-centric Built Environment
* Applied Machine Learning & Data Analytics
* Internet-of-Things (IoT) & Sensing
* Occupancy Detection
* Personal Thermal Comfort
* Energy Demand & Smart Energy Systems

as part of Smart and Sustainable Building Technologies.

My primary research focuses on applying concepts from machine learning, data mining, and IoT technologies to gain insights into 
occupant behaviour and develop intelligent systems to reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort in the built environment. 
As part of my thesis, I developed and patented a smart energy management system, Plug-Mate, 
which automated the operation of appliances by detecting users' presence through their smartphones' Bluetooth signals to 
support building automation and reduce energy consumption in office spaces.

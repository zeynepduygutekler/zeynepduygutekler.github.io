I am currently holding a Ph.D. Degree in Engineering Product Development from
Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre. 
Prior of my Ph.D., I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics 
as a double major from Isik University, where I was nominated the Valedictorian and Salutatorian of my cohort in 2015.

Broadly, my research interests are
* IoT Applications
* Smart Energy Management Systems
* Mobile Sensing 
* Indoor Localization

as part of **Smart Cities and Sustainable Building Technologies.**

My primary research focuses on applying concepts from machine learning, 
data analytics, mobile sensing, indoor localisation, and IoT technologies to gain insights into 
occupant behaviour in office spaces and develop innovative solutions to reduce energy consumption in the workplace. 
As part of my thesis, I developed a smart energy management system, Plug-Mate,
which automates the operation of office appliances based on the users' presence and preference information to 
reduce office energy consumption.

I am a postdoctoral reseacher at EDOL. test
I was previously a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS). 
I am part of the [Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) Lab](https://ideaslab.io/) led by Prof. Adrian Chong.

I am holding a Ph.D. Degree in Engineering Product Development from
Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre. 
Prior of my Ph.D., I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics 
as a double major from Isik University, where I was nominated the Valedictorian and Salutatorian of my cohort in 2015.

Broadly, my research interests are:
* Internet-of-Things (IoT) Applications
* Indoor Localization
* Mobile Sensing
* Building Automation
* Machine Learning

as part of **Smart Cities and Sustainable Building Technologies.**

My primary research focuses on applying concepts from machine learning, 
data analytics, mobile sensing, indoor localization, and IoT technologies to gain insights into 
occupant behaviour and develop innovative solutions to reduce energy consumption while maintaining user comfort. 
As part of my thesis, I developed and patented a smart energy management solution, Plug-Mate, 
which automates the operation of appliances by detecting users' presence through their smartphones' Bluetooth signals to 
support building automation and reduce energy consumption in office spaces.

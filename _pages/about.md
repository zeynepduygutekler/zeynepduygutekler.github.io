I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Energy Demand Observatory and Laboratory (EDOL)](https://edol.uk/) within the Department of Engineering Science, Junior Research Fellow at [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/our-people/zey-nep/) and Research Associate at [Oriel College](https://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/) at the **University of Oxford** :gb: 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) Lab](https://ideaslab.io/) within the Department of the Built Environment at the **National University of Singapore** :singapore: in 2021-2023.

I earned my a Ph.D. in Engineering Product Development from **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre** :singapore: :us: in 2021. 
Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics 
as a double major from **Isik University** :tr:, where I was awarded as the Valedictorian :trophy: in 2015. 

Broadly, my research interests include:
* Human-centric AI-driven Built Environment
* Applied Machine Learning & Data Analytics
* Internet-of-Things (IoT) & Sensing
* Occupancy Detection
* Personal Thermal Comfort
* Energy Demand & Smart Energy Systems

as part of Smart Cities and Sustainable Building Technologies.

My primary research focuses on applying concepts from machine learning, 
data mining, and IoT technologies to gain insights into 
occupant behaviour and develop intelligent systems to reduce energy consumption while maintaining user comfort in the built environment. 
As part of my thesis, I developed and patented a smart energy management system, Plug-Mate, 
which automates the operation of appliances by detecting users' presence through their smartphones' Bluetooth signals to 
support building automation and reduce energy consumption in office spaces.

I am currently a final year **Ph.D. Candidate in the [Engineering Product Development](https://epd.sutd.edu.sg/) pillar,
under [SUTD-MIT International Design Centre](https://idc.sutd.edu.sg/) at [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).](https://sutd.edu.sg/)**
During my Ph.D., I did my internship at SIMTech, A*STAR on a exploratory study that on Singapore's food manufacturing industry in 2019.(Details here)
I have also completed my research attachment with SinBerBEST (Berkeley Education Alliance for Research) on an energy management project using machine learning approaches in 2020. (Details here) 


I received my Master's and Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Engineering and Economics as a double major from [Isik University](http://www.isikun.edu.tr/en),
where I respectively nominated the Valedictorian and and Salutatorian in 2015.

My research interests are broadly **IoT and Smart Energy Management Systems,
Mobile Sensing as well as Indoor Localisation** as part of **Smart and Sustainable Building Technologies.**
My primary research focuses on applying different concepts from machine learning, data analytics, human behaviour studies, 
and IoT technology to gain insights into occupant behaviour in office spaces and develop innovative solutions to 
reduce energy consumption. 

Some of my recent works involve deploying smart sensors around the office to detect 
the wireless signals emitted by the occupants' smartphone devices and using supervised machine learning techniques to 
infer the occupants' presence and room-level location. By combining the occupants' presence information and 
the power consumption patterns of neighbouring devices through a data fusion approach, I was able to analyse and gain 
useful insights into the occupants' usage patterns and categorised them into a set of behavioural profiles using 
unsupervised machine clustering techniques. Moreover, I am developing a smart energy management system using Python, 
known as Plug-Mate, which automates the operation of the different electronic devices in the office 
based on the users' presence and past behavioural patterns to reduce their energy consumption.

I am currently a final year **Ph.D. Candidate** at the **Singapore University of Technology and Design** (SUTD) 
under the Engineering Product Development pillar and a researcher under the SUTD-MIT International 
Design Centre. I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics 
as a double major from Isik University, where I was nominated the **Valedictorian and Salutatorian** 
of my cohort in 2015.

Broadly, my research interests are
* IoT Applications
* Smart Energy Management Systems
* Mobile Sensing 
* Indoor Localisation

as part of **Smart Cities and Sustainable Building Technologies.**

My primary research focuses on applying concepts from machine learning, 
data analytics, mobile sensing, indoor localisation, and IoT technology to gain insights into 
occupant behaviour in office spaces and develop innovative solutions to reduce energy consumption in the workplace. 
As part of my thesis, I am currently developing a smart energy management system, Plug-Mate,
which automates the operation of office appliances based on the users' presence and preference information to 
reduce office energy consumption.

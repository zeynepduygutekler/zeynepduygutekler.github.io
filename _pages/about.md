I am currently a final year **Ph.D. Candidate in the [Engineering Product Development](https://epd.sutd.edu.sg/) pillar, under [SUTD-MIT International Design Centre](https://idc.sutd.edu.sg/) at [Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD).](https://sutd.edu.sg/)**
During my Ph.D., I did my internship at SIMTech, A*STAR on a exploratory study that I have developed a waste management behavioral framework on Singapore's food manufacturing industry for 6 months. I have also recently completed my research attachment with SinBerBEST (Berkeley Education Alliance for Research) on a projects for 9 months where I developed a plug load identification 
model using machine learning approaches in office spaces.

I received my Master's and Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Engineering and Economics as a double major from [Isik University](http://www.isikun.edu.tr/en), where I respectively nominated the Valedictorian and and Salutatorian in 2015.

My research interests are broadly **IoT and Smart Energy Management Systems, Mobile Sensing as well as Indoor Localisation** as part of Smart and Sustainable Building Technologies

As a researcher in the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre, my primary research focuses on applying different
concepts from machine learning, data analytics, human behaviour studies, and IoT technology to gain insights into
occupant behaviour in office spaces and develop innovative solutions to reduce energy consumption. Some of my recent
works involve deploying smart sensors around the office to detect the wireless signals emitted by the occupants'
smartphone devices and using supervised machine learning techniques to infer the occupants' presence and room-level
location. By combining the occupants' presence information and the power consumption patterns of neighbouring
devices through a data fusion approach, I was able to analyse and gain useful insights into the occupants' usage patterns
and categorised them into a set of behavioural profiles using unsupervised machine clustering techniques. Moreover, I
am developing a smart energy management system using Python, known as Plug-Mate, which automates the operation
of the different electronic devices in the office based on the users' presence and past behavioural patterns to reduce their
energy consumption. 

Besides my academic achievements, my prior research attachment, internship, and teaching assistantship have also
provided me with a wealth of valuable experience and highly transferrable skillsets for the working world. My current
research attachment with SinBerBEST (Berkeley Education Alliance for Research) has given me the rare opportunity
to collaborate and work with researchers and experts from different fields, cultural backgrounds, and geographical
locations. During my research attachment with SIMTech, A*STAR, I also had the chance to lead an exploratory study
on Singapore's food manufacturing industry by conducting field surveys and workshops with industry partners to better
understand the industry and their waste management decisions. Finally, my relevant internship experience in Turkish
Airlines Technic has also prepared me well for this job, where I analysed real-world data and developed optimisation
models that maximise production output while minimising discrepancies between actual and forecasted production

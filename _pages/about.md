I am currently a postdoctoral reseacher at the [Energy Demand Observatory and Laboratory (EDOL)](https://edol.uk/) within the Department of Engineering Science at the **University of Oxford** :gb: 

Previously, I held a postdoctoral research fellowship position at the [Integrated Data, Energy Analysis + Simulation (IDEAS) Lab](https://ideaslab.io/) within the Department of the Built Environment at the **National University of Singapore** :singapore:

I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering Product Development from **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre** :singapore: :us: in 2021. 
Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial Engineering and Economics 
as a double major from Isik University, where I was nominated as the Valedictorian in 2015. :tr: :trophy:

Broadly, my research interests are:
* Occupant-centric AI-driven Buildings 
* Internet-of-Things (IoT)
* Indoor Localization
* Building Automation
* Machine Learning

as part of Smart Cities and Sustainable Building Technologies.

My primary research focuses on applying concepts from machine learning, 
data mining, and IoT technologies to gain insights into 
occupant behaviour and develop innovative solutions to reduce energy consumption while maintaining user comfort. 
As part of my thesis, I developed and patented a smart energy management solution, Plug-Mate, 
which automates the operation of appliances by detecting users' presence through their smartphones' Bluetooth signals to 
support building automation and reduce energy consumption in office spaces.

I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the School of Architecture, Building and Civil Engineering at **Loughborough University.** I also hold a dual affiliation in the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/zeynep-duygu-tekler/) at the **University of Oxford** as a Senior Research Associate in AI for the Built Environment. At Oxford, I am part of the [ZERO Insitute](https://zero.ox.ac.uk/people/zeynep-tekler/) and have held a Junior Research Fellowship at [Kellogg College](https://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/our-people/zey-nep/) since 2023. 


Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of the Built Environment at the **National University of Singapore** in 2021-2023.
I earned my Ph.D. in Engineering Product Development from **Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) under the SUTD-MIT International Design Centre** in 2021. 
Prior to my doctoral studies, I received both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial Engineering, and Economics as a double major from **Isik University**, where I was awarded as the Valedictorian :trophy: in 2015. 

Broadly, my research interests include:
* Occupant-centric Built Environment
* Applied Machine Learning & Data Analytics
* Internet-of-Things (IoT) & Sensing
* Occupancy Detection
* Personal Thermal Comfort
* Energy Demand & Smart Energy Systems

as part of Smart and Sustainable Building Technologies.

My primary research focuses on applying concepts from machine learning, data mining, and IoT sensing technologies to understand occupant behaviour and develop intelligent systems that reduce energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort in the built environment. 
As part of my thesis, I developed and patented **Plug-Mate**, a smart energy management system that detects user presence via smartphones’ Bluetooth signals to automatically control appliances, enabling smarter building automation and reducing energy use in office spaces.
